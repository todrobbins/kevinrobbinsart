			<p style="margin-top: 0; padding: 0em 1em;">I am a college student currently enrolled at Utah Valley University, pursuing my dream to become an animator in film and games.  I am 2 years into my Bachelors of Science degree with an emphasis in gaming and animation, also pursuing skills in visual effects and compositing.  As there is currently not a visual effects and compositing major at UVU, a handful of students and I are reaching new lengths in this area, which includes us conceptualizing, designing and producing animations using a motion capture system.  We hope to bring that new level of technology to many more students interested in gaming and animation.</p>

			<p>My artistic journey began a long time ago, in a church far far away.  Ever since I can remember I drew and drew and drew during church meetings as a kid, and this all came from the encouragement my father gave me instead of shutting down my possibilities. Not only would he watch in awe and love it when I would gift the images to him when church was over, he would join in on the fun and explain perspective and line quality being a civil engineer himself.  His love for art and movies is what spawned my love for the same.  Star Wars ran strong in my family, and people have always asked what it was that made me want to go into animation and vfx, and that for sure is the root.  Lucasfilm did some great things which has only cross pollinated to other companies and studios in what they do today.  One of my favorite studios of all time, PIXAR, was made possible by the same men that brought Lucasfilm to life, they believed in John Lasseter and others involved and have made movie magic which will never be forgotten.  It’s that belief in someone else and their dream that really makes them go for it, and that is what my father was to me.</p>

			<p>This statement from my all time favorite animator inspires my work:</p>

			<div class="quote">
			<p>“Parents, sorry, you’re really not a good judge of art.  Most adults quit drawing in the fourth grade.  Therefore, their level ability to judge another’s drawing resides at a fourth grade level.  If a doctor’s education ended in the fourth grade, I don’t think I’d believe a word that came out of his mouth.  All children are in a rapid state of mental growth.  They are learning so much faster than adults can and although an adult may see rough scribbles on the paper, that child could have had a major breakthrough in emotional color theory.  Scribble…not important.  The color choice before the scribble…major artistic breakthrough.</p>

			<p>What parents should do:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Tell them how happy you are to see them drawing.</li>

			<li>Tell them how much you love to see their drawings and how it makes you feel.</li>

			<li>Encourage them to keep drawing what they love to draw.</li>

			<li>Above everything, teach them to continue to LOVE to draw. Do not talk about getting better.  That talk will fill them with anxiety that they have to start to meet a social standard of good art. And that unrealistic standard frequently turns to fear of art and ultimately quitting art.</li>
			</ul>
